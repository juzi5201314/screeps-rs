# screeps-rs

A [screeps](https://screeps.com) rust api binding.

The original js api binding provided by this project, but **not complete**.

Because this was created for my own screeps ai, but the api translation is boring, 
I don't have much energy to translate all the apis, 
so I can only maintain the apis I currently use.

### Why not [screeps-game-api](https://github.com/rustyscreeps/screeps-game-api)?
Because when I created this project, 
the master branch of screeps-game-api was still using `stdweb`.
